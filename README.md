### VI Task Automation Graphic ###

Moving colored blocks that slowly converge onto an image of a food. There are many pixel art food images that it randomly selects. As the automation metric goes up, we'll see more and more blocks. We only see blocks covering the percentage of the screen corresponding to the VI Task percentage. 

## Data Entry Automation Graphic  ##

The display shows 100 blocks that correspond to the data entry automation. The blocks collapse in a random direction, and then expand with positions switched at random.

## Sales Graphic  ##

A wavy grid of squares that becomes more uniform as the error rate decreases. The number of rows corresponds to the 30 day error rate. The color of the square grid changes when it crosses a row to make a mesmerizing display!
