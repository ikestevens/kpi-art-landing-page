## What is this ?? ##

This display shows two important automation metrics that the Data Science team monitors closely. These numbers are updated daily.

### VI Task Automation ###

The percentage of Vendor Items that are successfully categorized into their food category using ML models.

The graphic shows a random allocation of blocks, they slowly rearrange to converge on a food. However, only the VI Task Automation percentage of blocks are showing, so over time, we'll see more and more of the image as the percentage increases.

### Data Entry Automation ###

The full percentage shows how many invoices we successfully parse all of the information from using programmatic and machine learning techniques. Partial automation means we automated a portion of the invoice.

The graphic shows slow moving ribbons following a flow field algorithm, the ribbon colors correspond to the percentage of each category. It's like a fancy pie chart.
