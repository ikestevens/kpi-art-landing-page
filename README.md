## What is this ?? ##

This display shows two important automation metrics that the Data Science team monitors closely. These numbers are updated daily. Talk to Ike to learn more!

### VI Task Automation Graphic ###

Moving colored blocks that slowly converge onto an image of a food. There are many pixel art food images that it randomly selects. As the automation metric goes up, we'll see more and more blocks. We only see blocks covering the percentage of the screen corresponding to the VI Task percentage. 

## Data Entry Automation Graphic  ##

Swimming ribbons whose color distribution matches the automation percentages. The movements and ribbon length are random.
